# QC Report

This report presents metrics from the image analysis of sample ${meta.id}. Images were processed using GrandQC, 
a deep learning-based tool designed to assess whole-slide image integrity and detect common artifacts. 
By segmenting tissue and identifying issues such as folds, pen marks, and out-of-focus regions, GrandQC 
helps ensure that image data is well-characterized for downstream analysis.

## Methods  

Whole-slide images (WSIs) for sample **${meta.id}** were analyzed using GrandQC, an open-source deep learning-based tool for tissue segmentation and artifact detection. The analysis was performed in two stages:  

1. **Tissue Segmentation:** GrandQCâ€™s tissue detection model identified tissue regions, distinguishing them from the background to provide a refined target for subsequent artifact detection.  
2. **Artifact Segmentation:** A pre-trained GrandQC artifact model was applied to detect and classify common slide artifacts, including tissue folds, pen markings, dark spots, air bubbles, slide edges, and out-of-focus regions.  

GrandQC models were selected based on the optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency, with analysis performed at 7x magnification. The outputs include segmented tissue masks and artifact maps, which provide insights into potential issues affecting image integrity.
